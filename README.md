          The app is being made on behalf of ECO IT solutions,
          
          which offers tutoring on various Information Technology related topics.
         
          When a user wants a one on one tutorial, they come to the app and look for free timeslots
          of the instructors and then book a timeslot. 
         
          This meeting should then be reflected on the google calendars of all attendees of the meeting.
           Google calender permission is needed to make this happen.
